## **This is the group Project 1 by Pod 14 for the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp October 19th, 2022**

### **ABOUT**
We have created a music quiz app that will test your knowledge of 80's artists and their song titles by displaying one of their songs lyrics. The player can answer with the correct artist name or song title. We will also be able to show the current winning streak(high score) point count.
---
---
### **WHY**
Users enjoy testing their musical trivia knowledge against themselves and others. The app will keep the highest score of the current players while the app is open to encourage more quiz play.
---
---
### **HOW**
Along with HTML/CSS and Javascript we are using the Spotify and Genius Lyrics API's to retrieve the data that the quiz will use which includes lyrics, songs and artists. We will use local storage to keep track of the "Current Streak" high score.
